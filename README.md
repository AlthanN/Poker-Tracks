Created a poker tracking website that takes in buy in values from current players, and ensures that final chip counts are accurate for quick and efficient poker games. 

User can easily add players with names and buy in counts, which can also be modified before and during each poker session. Once a user ends the session, they are prompted
to enter final chip counts, and once all values are entered, the website will do a quick calculation to see if the counts are accurate and if they aren't, they will say
by how much, until the user finally enters the proper amount that adds to the total buy in. 

This was created with React, JavaScript, Figma, and Tailwind CSS.
